INTRODUCTION
============

FreeCG is an open-source clone of Crazy Gravity
(http://www.xlmsoft.de/crazygravity.php). The main goal of the project is to
provide a logically exact clone of the original game with some minor user
interface and graphics tweaks.


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==================

FreeCG depends on SDL and OpenGL. Building is very simple:
make

In order to work FreeCG requires the original graphics and level files from
the distribution of Crazy Gravity. Currently only files from version 2.0E are
supported. Support for current version (2004) will be added soon.
These files are freely available on the internet, but their legal status is
considered unknown. You may have to be the owner of the full Crazy Gravity
license to use them in FreeCG.
